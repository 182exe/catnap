- An open source Discord bot written with NodeJS with misc features not normally given by other bots.

  2. download the latest release source from [here](https://github.com/182exe/catnap/releases/latest "A dynamic download to the latest update") and unarchive the download into your folder of choice
  3. open `configexample.json` and fill out the values with your bot information from your Discord app
  4. rename `configexample.json` to `config.json`
  5. run `start.bat`
- Invite my bot that I host to your server:
